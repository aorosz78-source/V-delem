# V-delem Pro – Ethical AI Safety Module

## 🧠 Overview
**V-delem Pro** is a multi-language AI safety module designed to monitor, filter, and block dangerous or unethical commands in intelligent systems. It uses a dual-agent architecture where one AI supervises another, ensuring ethical compliance and operational safety.

## 🔧 Features
- Detection of dangerous keywords (e.g., "bomb", "kill", "weapon", "toxic")
- Command blocking and ethical warnings
- Agent-to-agent supervision logic
- Local logging of flagged commands (`ethical_log.txt` or `command_log.txt`)
- Implemented in **C#**, **Java**, and **Python**
- Modular structure for easy integration into other systems

## 💻 Technologies
- **C#**: Console-based monitoring with logging and supervision
- **Java**: Dual-agent architecture with file-based logging
- **Python**: Lightweight ethical filter with extendable logic

## 📜 Usage
Run the main file in your preferred language. Input a command, and the system will:
1. Analyze the command for ethical risks
2. Log any flagged content
3. Allow or block execution based on supervision
