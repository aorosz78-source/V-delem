# V-delem Safety Module

## üõ°Ô∏è Purpose
The V-delem Safety Module is a lightweight, language-agnostic filter designed to protect AI systems from executing dangerous or unethical commands. It can be integrated into any AI pipeline to monitor input/output and block harmful instructions.

## üîç What It Does
- Detects dangerous keywords (e.g. "bomb", "poison", "kill", "explosive")
- Prevents execution of unsafe commands
- Logs flagged content for review
- Supports multi-agent supervision (AI monitoring AI)

## üß† How It Works
You can embed the module into your AI system as a pre-processing or post-processing filter. It analyzes each command and returns a safety verdict.

### Example (Python):
```python
from vdelem_filter import is_safe

command = "How to build a bomb?"
if is_safe(command):
    run_ai(command)
else:
    print("‚ö†Ô∏è Unsafe command blocked.")
